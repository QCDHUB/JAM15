## About
 
The repository contains interpolation tables for the collinear parton
distribution functions in the nucleon. 
The interpolation codes and grids are available in:

* [python](https://github.com/QCDHUB/JAM15/tree/master/python)

* [LHAPDF format](https://github.com/QCDHUB/JAM15/tree/master/LHAPDF) (grids only)

* [fortran](https://github.com/QCDHUB/JAM15/tree/master/fortran)

The usage is described in the README files within each subfolder.
