## Abstract

We present a comprehensive new global QCD analysis of polarized inclusive deep-inelastic scattering, 
including the latest high-precision data on longitudinal and transverse polarization asymmetries from 
Jefferson Lab and elsewhere. The analysis is performed using a new iterative Monte Carlo fitting 
technique which generates stable fits to polarized parton distribution functions (PDFs) with statistically 
rigorous uncertainties. Inclusion of the Jefferson Lab data leads to a reduction in the PDF errors for 
the valence and sea quarks, as well as in the gluon polarization uncertainty at xâ‰³0.1. The study also 
provides the first determination of the flavor-separated twist-3 PDFs and the d2 moment of the nucleon 
within a global PDF analysis.
